# IoT-Based-Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System
This repository contains code and documentation for an IoT-based Air Pollution Monitoring System. The system employs an MSP430F5529LP microcontroller, programmed with Energia IDE, along with an ESP8266-01 Bluetooth Module and MQ - sensors which enables users to remotely access and analyze the air pollution data in real-time.
